### Runtime enforcement for LLM agents

Building **VERONICA** — a runtime safety layer that sits between autonomous agents and your API bill.

One unguarded loop on a Friday can mean $12K by Monday.  
VERONICA enforces hard limits before damage happens.

## What I build

**VERONICA (LLM Runtime Enforcement)**
- Hard budget limits (HALT, not alert)
- Step limits & loop control
- Concurrency gating
- Crash-resilient state transitions
- Designed for engineers, not dashboards

**HyperRasterizer (3D Gaussian Splatting)**
- Custom CUDA rasterizer (Apache 2.0)
- RTX 5090 / Blackwell optimized
- Solves commercial licensing constraints in 3DGS

**HyperViewer**
- WebGPU-based 3DGS viewer
- Browser-native, no plugin
