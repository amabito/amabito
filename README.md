### Runtime enforcement for LLM agents

Building **VERONICA** — a runtime safety layer that sits between autonomous agents and your API bill.

One unguarded loop on a Friday can mean $12K by Monday.
VERONICA enforces hard limits before damage happens.

## What I build

**[veronica-core](https://github.com/amabito/veronica-core) — LLM Runtime Enforcement**
- Hard budget limits (HALT, not alert)
- Step limits & loop control
- Circuit breaker with AG2 integration (v1.0.1)
- Crash-resilient state transitions
- `pip install veronica-core`

**[HyperRasterizer](https://github.com/amabito/hyper-rasterizer) — 3D Gaussian Splatting**
- Custom CUDA rasterizer (Apache 2.0)
- RTX 5090 / Blackwell optimized
- Solves commercial licensing constraints in 3DGS

**[HyperViewer](https://github.com/amabito/hyper-viewer)**
- WebGPU-based 3DGS viewer
- Browser-native, no plugin
