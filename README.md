**Runtime enforcement for LLM agents.**

I build the safety layer between autonomous agents and production disasters. Not monitoring — enforcement. Hard stops before damage happens.

## What I build

**[veronica-core](https://github.com/amabito/veronica-core)** — Runtime containment for LLM agents
- Hard budget enforcement (HALT, not alert)
- Step limits, loop control, circuit breakers
- Crash-resilient state machine (1,780 tests)
- AG2 framework integration — [invited by core maintainer](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/pull/2430)
- `pip install veronica-core`

## Background

Construction infrastructure consultant turned AI engineer. 10+ years in regulated, zero-tolerance environments where failure has real-world cost. Now applying that mindset to LLM agent safety.

## Technical

Python · C++ · CUDA · TypeScript · WebGPU

Runtime enforcement · Multi-agent orchestration · GPU systems · 3D graphics pipelines

## Open to work

Available for remote contract work — AI safety, agent infrastructure, runtime systems.
